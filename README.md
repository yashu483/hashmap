## Introduction:

DSA practice : creating a hashmap data structure using javascript. This repository contains solution of a DSA exercise to create a hashmap data structure containing some methods and properties we get in built-in Map() constructor in javascript. Main purpose of this exercise is to practice DSA.

## Methods and Properties in HashMap constructor:

1. length() -> returns the length of the hashmap
2. set(key,value) -> set can be use to set a new key and value or change value of an existing key.
3. get(key) -> returns value of the key if available, else null.
4. has(key) returns true if hashmap contains the key else false.
5. remove(key) -> removes the key from hashmap
6. clear() -> remove all keys from hashmap
7. keys() -> returns an array containing all the keys that hashmap contains
8. values() -> returns an array containing all of the values for all the keys that hashmap contains
9. entries() -> returns an array containing key-value pair for every keys of the hashmap
